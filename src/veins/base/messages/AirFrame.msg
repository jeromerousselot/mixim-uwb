//
// Format of the packets that are sent to the channel
//
// subclass if you want to create your own AirFrame packet class
// (see Omnet manual, chapter Messages - Inheritance among packet 
// classes).
//
// This packet format is used to send a packet from the physical
// layer to the channel. All other physical layers that can 'hear'
// this packet can evaluate noise, interference etc. from the
// information contained in this packet (especially the signal):
//
// Note: BasePhy layer creates AirFrames with a slightly higher 
// priority than normal to ensure channel consistency. This means that before anything else happens
// at a time point t every AirFrame which ended at t has been removed and
// every AirFrame started at t has been added to the channel.
//
// If you need more fields for whatever reason, please do NOT create
// your own packet! Just extend (subclass) this packet format
