 * @brief The Antenna class is the base class of all antenna models.

 * The purpose of all Antenna classes is to calculate the antenna gain
 * based on the current positions and orientations of the involved nodes.
 *
 * This base Antenna acts as an isotropic antenna, it always returns
 * a gain of 1.0. It is assigned to all nodes if the user does not specify
 * another antenna type.

     * @param ownOrient - the direction the antenna/the host is pointing in
     * @param otherPos  - the position of the other antenna which this antenna
     * is sending to or receiving from
     *
     * @return Returns the gain in this specific direction.
